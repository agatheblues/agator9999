# agator9999: A music albums library

## About
agator9999 is a music library that lists your favourite albums from various streaming sources, in one place. It has a Spotify and a Discogs integration for enriched metadata.

## But why?
It all started when Spotify told me: *"Epic collection, friend. Your library is all filled up. To save more, you'll need to remove some songs."*. Hitting the 'Save' button on an album has a limit: you can save 10 000 songs in your library. I am constantly seeking new music, but I cannot remember all of the artists and albums I listened to, so I use my Spotify library as my music *storage* place. Until now, because it's full. That's why I created agator9999: to have my own *storage* place where there can be albums from Spotify, as well as other streaming sources like Bandcamp.

## What can you do with agator9999?

**Artists**
- View your artist library (Artists are derived from your saved albums.)

**Albums**
- View your saved albums for a given artist
- Synchronize your Spotify saved albums
- Add an album by providing its Spotify URI (listening + metadata) and its Discogs URL (metadata)
- Add an album by providing its Youtube or Bandcamp URL (listening) and its Discogs URL (metadata)
- Improve the default Spotify album metadata by linking an album from Spotify to its Discogs equivalent (at the moment, it adds genres and styles tags).
- Search your artists
- Sort alphabetically and by recently added
- Link to the corresponding listening platform.

## What agator9999 does not do?

- Play music. It's a *storage* place. Like a shelf. Shelves don't play music. In the end it's just a nicer, browsable, nicely looking version of a library spreadsheet.

## How to use it?
agator9999 is a modest [React](https://reactjs.org/) web application which uses [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/?authuser=0) as back-end.

**Firebase Setup**

1. First, clone the project.
2. Rename the file to `config.template.json` to `config.js`.
2. Then, to use agator9999, you need to create a Firebase project. Go to the Firebase website, log in / sign in and select `Add Firebase to your web app` (select the web option): a pop-up with your configuration will appear. Copy the configuration values and replace them in `firebaseConfig` in the file `config.js`.
3. Go to `Database`, choose to create a `Real-time Database` and set the `Rules` as follow (temporary):

```
{
  "rules": {
    ".read":"auth != null",
    ".write": "false"
  }
}
```

**Spotify Setup**

4. Then, you need to create your Spotify application: go to the [Developer Dashboard](https://beta.developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login) and hit `Create an app`. You can name your application and select a non-commercial option.
6. Go to `Edit Settings` and set a callback URI for your application. For example, `http://localhost:8888/#/callback`.
7. Go to `config.js` at the root at the project, fill in the `spotifyConfig`: add the URI to the 'REDIRECT_URI' field and add your Spotify `CLIENT_ID` (that you can get from the Dashboard).

**Discogs Setup**

8. Go to [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/settings/developers) and create your Discogs application. You don't need to fill the callback URL.
9. Copy the Consumer key in `discogsConfig` in `config.js`. Keep secret aside for now.

**Customize application name**

You can change the `owner` value in `config.js` to customize the login page.

**Run the application**

10. To run the application locally:
- Do `npm install` at the root of the project.
- Do `node app.js` at the root of the project in a terminal.
- Open another terminal window, and do `npm start` at the root of the project.
- Check out http://localhost:8888/ !

**Setting your admin rights + Discogs secret**

The first time you access agator9999, you won't be able to login. Enable login with your Google account and you should at this moment only have read access. After you have logged in once, you can go set yourself as an admin:

11. Go to Firebase Authentication Page and go to Sign-in Method. Enable Google as an authentication provider.
12. In the Firebase Authentication Console, go to the `Users` tab.
13. Copy the `User UID` next to your Google account then go to `Data` and manually add a node at the root of your database as follow:

```json
{
	"users": {
		"yourCopiedUID": {
			"email": "myGoogleEmailAddress@gmail.com",
			"isAdmin": true
		}
	},
	"secrets": {
		"discogs_secret": "yourDiscogsSecret"
	}
}
```

The `isAdmin` tag gives you rights to write to your Firebase database to the given UID. Would you want to have several admins, you can add another user to the list. `".read":"auth != null",` means that any authenticated user has read access to your database. You can of course change the rules settings as you wish (see [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/security/)), and for example restrict the read rights to admin only.


14. Go to Database > Rules and change them to:

```
{
  "rules": {
    "users": {
      ".read":"auth != null",
      ".write":"root.child('users').child(auth.uid).child('isAdmin').val() == true",
      ".indexOn": ["email"]
    },
    "artists": {
      ".read":"auth != null",
      ".write":"root.child('users').child(auth.uid).child('isAdmin').val() == true",
      ".indexOn": ["sources/spotify", "sources/discogs"]
    },
    "albums": {
    	".read":"auth != null",
      ".write":"root.child('users').child(auth.uid).child('isAdmin').val() == true",
      ".indexOn": ["sources/spotify", "sources/discogs"]
    },
    "secrets": {
      ".read":"root.child('users').child(auth.uid).child('isAdmin').val() == true",
      ".write":false
    }
  }
}
```


If you now refresh your local page, you should see new features!


## How to deploy it?

Read this: [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/). You can run `npm run build` that will generate your bundle, init a firebase hosting folder, link it to your firebase project and move there `index.html`, `bundle.js`, `style.css` and the `static` folder. Then hit `firebase deploy`!

Note: Don't forget to add your hosting URL to your Spotify application callback list, and in `config.js`.

## Disclaimer
This tool has been created for personal use and not for commercial purposes. No artworks are stored in the database. Also, this is *just* a codebase. You have to setup your own things!

## Feedback
Do you have any feedback? Do you want to contribute to the project? I would be more than happy!
